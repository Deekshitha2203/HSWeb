                    Statement of Purpose (SOP) and Letters of Recommendation (LOR) offer a personalized narrative that complements your academic achievements. They portray you as a multifaceted individual beyond transcripts and test scores. SOPs and LORs provide admissions committees qualitative insights into your character, work ethic, and potential contributions to the academic community. Crafting compelling SOPs and securing strong LORs involves introspection, effective communication, and cultivating meaningful relationships with mentors. This ensures that your application reflects your unique qualifications and aspirations effectively. 

It is important to note that SOPs are not the same as resumes. SOPs focus on you as a person. They must not repeat any of the information specified in your resume.
